# Test
- As a standard user, go to https://www.saucedemo.com/, sort the list via lowest price, and purchase the 2 lowest priced items. The test will cover the full checkout end-to-end flow.
- Repeat the same tests for all other users.
  - Errors are expected for other users. The scenario will be error handling and trying to complete the flow for these users. All tests should pass.
